Dmitri went on a trip to the Himalayas by himself to discover the meaning of life. While on his trip, he met a guru who taught him the ways of being true to himself. Then he realized his life goals and passions along with the meaning of his life.

While climbing Mount Everest, Guru Tim had told him to let go and let nature control his actions, while maintaining personal safety. Tim and Dmitri were then caught in a snowstorm and had plenty of time to converse on life's meaning.
